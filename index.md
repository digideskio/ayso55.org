Butch Ducharme passed away suddenly on Friday September 11th, leaving behind 
his wife and three daughters. He was a loving husband to his wife Mona and a 
proud father to Olivia, Madeline and Gabrielle. 

Butch touched countless lives through everything he did in the 
community - always with a smile on his face. 

He meant so much to the children and families of AYSO and made a huge impact 
in many lives over his 16 years of service as a coach, referee and 
Commissioner of Region 55.  We are truly heartbroken.
 
<!--The vigil will be Monday 9/21/15 at 7pm, and the Memorial Service will be 
Tuesday 9/22/15 at 10:30am with a reception to follow at the church hall.
Services will be held at St. Bonaventure Church located at 
16400 Springdale Street, Huntington Beach, Ca 92649 -->

In lieu of flowers, we ask that donations be made through 
[this account](http://www.gofundme.com/2m48e8jc) 
to help give back to his wife and children the love we all received 
from Butch.

### Region Handbook

The [Region Handbook](/docs/Fall2015/AYSOR55RegionHandbook2015.pdf) has all the
info for our Region 55. Check it out for any questions you may have.

### Notice About Drones

On August 25, 2015, the Region 55 Board approved a resolution to prohibit the
use of drones at games, practices and scrimmages. Soccer is a player's game.
The Board's concerns range from a drone interfering with the game to the very
real possibility that the drone will come down and hurt someone. Therefore,
in order to ensure the health, welfare and safety of our players, coaches,
officials and spectators Region 55 is prohibiting the use of drones. Referees
have also been instructed to suspend the match if a drone is seen flying
over the playing field.

Thanks for being an ambassador of the game and for your help in providing a
fun, safe and positive experience to our youth players.

## Become a Volunteer

### Contact the [CVPA](mailto://cvpa@ayso55.org) for volunteering.

The Child and Volunteer Protection Advocate CVPA can help! We need coaches, 
referees, and lots of other help to keep Region 55 strong.

## AYSO VIP Program

Region 55 is starting up a VIP program! In the meantime, please see
[Region 143's](http://www.ayso143.org/vip) site for more information on the VIP program. Remember, AYSO is Everyone Plays!
