Butch Ducharme passed away suddenly on Friday September 11th, leaving behind 
his wife and three daughters. He was a loving husband to his wife Mona and a 
proud father to Olivia, Madeline and Gabrielle. 

Butch touched countless lives through everything he did in the 
community - always with a smile on his face. 

He meant so much to the children and families of AYSO and made a huge impact 
in many lives over his 16 years of service as a coach, referee and 
Commissioner of Region 55.  We are truly heartbroken.
 
<!--The vigil will be Monday 9/21/15 at 7pm, and the Memorial Service will be 
Tuesday 9/22/15 at 10:30am with a reception to follow at the church hall.
Services will be held at St. Bonaventure Church located at 
16400 Springdale Street, Huntington Beach, Ca 92649 -->

In lieu of flowers, we ask that donations be made through 
[this account](http://www.gofundme.com/2m48e8jc) 
to help give back to his wife and children the love we all received 
from Butch.

### Welcome to the Fall 2015 Season!

Region 55 Players, and Volunteers, Friends, Families

Welcome to Fall 2015!

As your Commissioner, I'm excited each year to share with you where we are as 
a Region and especially the tireless efforts of our volunteers!

As we roll into our third consecutive year as a **Platinum Region**, the highest 
honor any Region can earn, I'm again proud not just for the continued 
excellence but the commitment our Leadership Team displays 12 months of the
year to provide the best possible experience for the kids, parents, and
volunteers of Region 55!

Our player enrollment continues to be nearly 1200 kids, we'll uniform about
140 teams, playing at 6 locations, and with over 1000 games in 10 weeks... it's
a BIG operation! Special note to our friends at OVSD, we are fortunate to
have developed a strong working relationship with OVSD, helping ensure we
have fields to play on each year. Special thank you to **Cindy Pulfer at OVSD**
offices as she is always watching out for Region 55! If you know Cindy, say
thank you!

In addition to the facilities, there is no way just a few folks can pull
this off... it takes an awful lot of dedicated people, shameful hours, expert
coordination, egoless cooperation, mutual support, and a burning desire to
make it all happen. I am extremely proud of the group of people I get the
pleasure of working with throughout the year. Let me take you through this
awesome group of volunteers!

While our Board has about 25 people, a significant part of it is our
**Division Coordinators**.

* **Stephanie Clobes** and **Troy Johnson** at Sun View, U14-U19 Boys and Girls
* **Wally Dubno** and **Paul Kirby** at Glen View, U12 Boys and Girls
* **Dean West** and **Cliff Macklin** at Spring View, U10 Boys
* **Heather Perez** and **Jeff Biggins** at College View U10 Girls
* **Valerie McCarthy**, **Christine Appell**, and **Doreen Saporito** at Lark View U8 Boys and Girls
* **Kelly Rice**, **Christine Knip**, **Mimi Carles**, and **John Rice** at Westmont U6 Boys and Girls

They are magnificent! These leaders have pulled this Fall season together 
better than any year I can recall! They worked many hours to ensure your 
coaches know where to go to get certified, that your referees are aware of 
the trainings available, the team parents have Safe Haven training, etc...
Thank them when you see them at your field on game day! Thank them for on 
other days too! I thank them every chance I can, for without their 
collective efforts I'm not sure where we'd be!

**Anne Brasie** - our Secretary, keeps the minutes at our Board meetings. 
I've been told I talk a lot so her job isn't easy! Thanks Anne!

Reading this on our website? Thank **Dan Minear** our Webmaster extraordinaire!

Shout-Outs - **Matt Ashley**, **Steve Jacobsen**, **Marvin Springer**, **Bruce Bartos**, 
**David Wiley**, **Andy Mindlin**, **Hamid Jafroudi** (Gosh - I may have left a couple 
folks out, but know that I appreciate the heck outta ya!) - These tenured 
volunteers give significant time to assist in the vital coach and referee
 trainings throughout July, August and into September. Thank you Gentlemen! 

Special Shout-Out - **Debby Brown**! Debby, new to Region 55, was asked to 
coordinate our new Team Parent role and she has owned it from the beginning! 
I was fortunate enough to witness the remarkable turnout and presentation at 
the inaugural Team Parent meeting held a couple weeks ago - {{{WOW!!!}}} 
Debby has ensured every team parent is fully on-board and ready to roll!

Super-Special Shout Out - **Becky Kirby**! I asked Becky to take over the game 
schedules. Becky never hesitated! Tireless efforts to de-conflict game 
schedules for coaches that may be coaching two or more teams, creating the 
matrix that made my head spin! Becky, unbelievable work under fire... you are 
fabulous!

Our Core Board

**Denise English** and **Marianne Low** - our Registrars - Denise and Marianne have 
rallied through all the registrations and created our balanced rosters. 
Handled player drops, replacements, countless phone calls from me and others, 
all with a “can-do” attitude and a smile! These two ladies are invaluable!

**Mark DiLauro**, **Jason Kakimoto**, and **Paul Kirby** - our Coach Administrators are 
beyond compare! Ensuring Region 55 coaches are age-appropriate trained and 
volunteering their time to mentor new coaches throughout the season! Oh, and 
they coach on our highly competitive Extra teams too! I'm always consulting 
these gentlemen, seeking their input on matters related to coaches, players, 
and general day-to-day operations. Thank you guys!

**Melissa Delgeize**  - our Treasurer utilizes the newest AYSO accounting 
systems, one of the first regions in the country to fully adopt this system! 
Thank you Melissa!

**Hovannes Daniels** - "Hov", our Child and Volunteer Protection Advocate, is 
ALWAYS working to clear volunteers and provide the Region guidance on 
personnel matters. I lean on his insight regularly. Thank you Hov! 

**Loren Maddy** - our Referee Administrator, along with **Peter Furman** (Director 
of Mentoring) and **Rick Sedivy** (Director of Instruction) have created a 
referee program that is the gold standard! Loren took over the lead role 
just last year and has implemented strategic initiatives that have been 
instrumental in developing our program! Providing the opportunities for new 
referees to gain certifications and mentoring them along the way. Loren, 
Peter, and Rick have also fostered a blossoming youth referee program that 
provides an opportunity for our kids to gain confidence and grow while 
officiating youth soccer! To my fellow referees, you guys are awesome!

**Dani DeGrood** - our Safety Director ensures that we have a dedicated point 
lady for all AYSO safety related queries. When a child or volunteer is 
injured, Dani takes the lead with precision and professionalism! We are 
very lucky to have Dani on our Board!

When you see the many folks helping put this together, take a few minutes 
to thank them, for we are all volunteers! I invite you to be a part of this 
great organization, grab a paint sprayer, setup a goal, get involved, enjoy 
the moments, and remember it is only a game played by kids!

Warmest Regards,

Butch

### Region Handbook

The [Region Handbook](/docs/Fall2015/AYSOR55RegionHandbook2015.pdf) has all the
info for our Region 55. Check it out for any questions you may have.

### Notice About Drones

On August 25, 2015, the Region 55 Board approved a resolution to prohibit the
use of drones at games, practices and scrimmages. Soccer is a player's game.
The Board's concerns range from a drone interfering with the game to the very
real possibility that the drone will come down and hurt someone. Therefore,
in order to ensure the health, welfare and safety of our players, coaches,
officials and spectators Region 55 is prohibiting the use of drones. Referees
have also been instructed to suspend the match if a drone is seen flying
over the playing field.

Thanks for being an ambassador of the game and for your help in providing a
fun, safe and positive experience to our youth players.
