## 2013-2014 REGIONAL ASSESSMENT AWARD - PLATINUM!

As Commissioner of Region 55, I am pleased to report your region has achieved the highest honor available in AYSO - PLATINUM!

The Regional Assessment Award recognizes the success and dedication of the Regional Board and its volunteers and is designed to recognize Regions for their successful implementation of AYSO programs in their local communities. Regions that actively support AYSO philosophies and policies, strive for constant improvement and demonstrate a commitment to training its volunteers. Additionally, AYSO is looking for the effective use of resources, quality delivery of services, and innovation.

To achieve Platinum status, Region 55 had to attain at least 90% of the available 340 points of the assessment. The five categories where Region 55 excelled were Administration, Coach, Referee, Finance, and Community Involvement.

Congratulations to all who have helped lead Region 55 as one of the premier regions in all of AYSO!

Thank you!

Butch
