### Region Handbook

The [Region Handbook](/docs/Fall2015/AYSOR55RegionHandbook2015.pdf) has all the
info for our Region 55. Check it out for any questions you may have.

### Notice About Drones

On August 25, 2015, the Region 55 Board approved a resolution to prohibit the
use of drones at games, practices and scrimmages. Soccer is a player's game.
The Board's concerns range from a drone interfering with the game to the very
real possibility that the drone will come down and hurt someone. Therefore,
in order to ensure the health, welfare and safety of our players, coaches,
officials and spectators Region 55 is prohibiting the use of drones. Referees
have also been instructed to suspend the match if a drone is seen flying
over the playing field.

Thanks for being an ambassador of the game and for your help in providing a
fun, safe and positive experience to our youth players.
