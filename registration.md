### Online signup help for new and returning volunteers

We are all volunteers, and we cannot run the program without your help. Region 55 is a bunch of dedicated individuals that like helping and enjoy seeing the smiles on the kids faces.

If a new volunteer (Coach, Ref, Team Parent, etc.), then follow the [new volunteers](/docs/Fall2015/New%20volunteers.pdf) handout.

If returning volunteer, then follow the [returning volunteers](/docs/Fall2015/Returning%20volunteers.pdf) handout.
