				</span></p>
				<p class="style1">Spring Recreation and Select programs are 
				March 13 through May 8th. These U10-U19 programs are coach 
				driven; meaning coaches must notify the region of their intent 
				to coach spring and be approved. Then they may choose players to 
				complete their roster. Should any opening remain on teams, 
				players will be added from our interest list. Teams play within 
				Area K which consists of <st1:City w:st="on">Huntington Beach</st1:City>, <st1:City w:st="on">
				Westminster</st1:City>,
<st1:City w:st="on">Fountain Valley</st1:City>, <st1:City w:st="on">Long Beach</st1:City>,
<st1:City w:st="on">Santa Ana</st1:City> and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Orange</st1:place></st1:City>. There will be home and away games. 
				Cost is $65 per player which includes a uniform. Guest players 
				must pay $80 to cover player fees and insurance. <o:p></o:p></p>
				<p class="style1">Recreation teams must consist of players who 
				played in fall 2009 within our region. Up to 3 All-Stars or 
				guest players are allowed. Divisions that play in rec are U10, 
				U12 and U14. Competitive play is de-emphasized. <o:p></o:p></p>
				<p class="style1">Select teams are more competitive in nature, 
				usually consisting of All-star and/or Plus caliber players. No 
				more than three guest players (non-region 55 fall season) are 
				allowed, no exceptions. <o:p></o:p></p>
				<p class="style1">ALL Spring Recreation and Select teams MUST 
				have three referees listed and prepared to referee games for 
				other region 55 teams at home. No team will be considered or 
				accepted without referees to support our program. Any team not 
				supporting our program with referees during the season will be 
				removed from the schedule. <o:p></o:p></p>
