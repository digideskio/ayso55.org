But more important than the on field success, our coaches and Region leadership strive to create a positive environment for the players and their families.  All players play a minimum 3/4 of each game.  Coaches are positive and focused on player development.  Your kids will have fun, be competitive and will develop their soccer skills.

### Overview of the Region 55 EXTRA Program

The EXTRA program is designed to give AYSO players an opportunity to participate in a more competitive level of soccer play without the substantial increase in cost, time commitment, and travel required of club soccer.
 
The AYSO EXTRA program is run during the Fall season. Teams may also participate in other pre and post season tournaments. Region 55 teams compete against other AYSO EXTRA teams from Section 11 (http://www.aysosection11.com) and (http://section11extra.org/). 

### Players

A player interested in the EXTRA program should understand the higher level of commitment and work that the program entails.  All players registered for the coming AYSO Fall season are welcome to tryout. Attendance at one of the  two posted tryout dates is mandatory in order to be considered for the team, however, attendance at both tryout sessions is highly encouraged. 
 
EXTRA Team players may not play on another AYSO standard primary program team during the same season nor will they be eligible for All-Star play.  Players selected to the EXTRA Program will commit to their teams as their primary non-school activity. It is expected that every player attends each practice and game at the agreed upon times.  In order to satisfy the commitment required by the Section Eleven EXTRA Program, players may not be enrolled and participate in other non-AYSO or Club soccer programs during the EXTRA Program season.
 
### Team Selection Process

EXTRA teams will be selected based on an open tryout process each season.  For each division Region 55 will determine if there is a sufficient pool of players with the appropriate skill level to hold a tryout.  Tryouts for selected divisions will be announced on the Region's website.  Tryouts are open to any player that meets the age and gender requirements for that respective division.  Members of an EXTRA team from a prior season are not guaranteed a spot on the current season team.  A committee of unbiased coaches will evaluate and rate all players that attend the tryout.  Coaches of a prior year EXTRA team are permitted to sit on the committee.  Coaches with their own child participating in the tryout may also sit on the committee, however, they will not evaluate their own child.  At the end of the tryout all player ratings will be compiled and reviewed.  Region 55 will determine if there are enough EXTRA caliber players to form a competitive EXTRA team, and if so, which players are selected.  Notification will be made within a reasonable time after the tryout.

### Roster Sizes

* U-11 teams: up to12 on roster, play 9v9 
* U-12 teams: up to 14 on roster, play  11v11
* U-13 teams: up to 14 on roster, play  11v11

### Tryouts times and locations 

Please arrive 15 minutes before your scheduled tryout.  Refer to the age guide below for the proper tryout division.  Players should be appropriately dressed to play soccer, including cleats & shinguards.  They should also bring a ball and water bottle with their name on it that they will carry with them throughout the tryout. All participants should sign-in early at the following link to avoid lines on tryout day and so we know how many players will be attending.  (http://goo.gl/forms/3SR1LnVNo9)
