Butch Ducharme passed away suddenly on Friday September 11th, leaving behind 
his wife and three daughters. He was a loving husband to his wife Mona and a 
proud father to Olivia, Madeline and Gabrielle. 

Butch touched countless lives through everything he did in the 
community - always with a smile on his face. 

He meant so much to the children and families of AYSO and made a huge impact 
in many lives over his 16 years of service as a coach, referee and 
Commissioner of Region 55.  We are truly heartbroken.
 
The vigil will be Monday 9/21/15 at 7pm, and the Memorial Service will be 
Tuesday 9/22/15 at 10:30am with a reception to follow at the church hall.
Services will be held at St. Bonaventure Church located at 
16400 Springdale Street, Huntington Beach, Ca 92649

In lieu of flowers, we ask that donations be made through 
[this account](http://www.gofundme.com/2m48e8jc) 
to help give back to his wife and children the love we all received 
from Butch.
