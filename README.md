These are the source files for the AYSO Region 55 website. The idea here is to update these files and then git push them back. The sync_to_aws is run automatically upon a webhook from github, so the code is pulled, harp compiled, and resynced to Amazon S3 where the live site resides.

This is for my own source control.  You can view the live site at [ayso55.org](http://ayso55.org).
